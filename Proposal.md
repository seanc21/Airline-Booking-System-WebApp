# Airline Booking System WebApp

## Description and Motivation
With the idea of my java project, I want to create a WebApp for my Airline Booking System. Giving the user the ability to either create an account or login. The user will be given choice's to book a flight, check-in, change flight information. They will also have access to different locations and can manage their departure/arrival time. The reason behind this project is to build something that has real world application and could eventually be built into something useful and effective.

## Prior Art
There are many Airline Booking System on the internet book I wanted to make something that is simply and easy to navigate through.

## Core User Workflow
- Account Creation/Login: A option to login to an existing account, or create a new account and login.
- Account Booking: Since this is a airline booking system. The user will need to book a roundtrip, or a oneway flight and have some options to change and check-in.
- Account Check-in: User will be able to check-in with a code.
- Account Refund: User will be able to get a full refund of their purchase.

## Goals
### Milestone 1 (1 day)
- Set Up and get project running with the spring initializr. Create template with detailed plans about projects.

### Milestone 2 (6-9 days)
- Add pages from the terminal CRUD JAVA PROJECT. This will include Booking, Check-in, refund page. For Booking feature will need to add picture of a plane seats so user will see what seats to book.

### Milestone 3 (1-2 days)
- User will be able to register and sign in/out. If time left over, will start on Milestone 4.

### Milestone 4 (remaining days)
- I want to add a rewards and change flight feature to make user book more flights.
